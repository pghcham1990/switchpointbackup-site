            SwitchPoint installs and manages a small on-site device that automatically switches your connection

        <!-- SEO-rich content section about regional internet failover -->
        <div class="seo-content" style="margin-top:24px">
          <h3>Why businesses in PA, OH, and WV need internet failover</h3>
          <p>
            Internet outages affect businesses of every size across Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.
            Whether you rely on Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon Fios, AT&amp;T, Frontier, Breezeline, Consolidated Communications,
            or any other regional ISP &mdash; outages happen. When they do, payments stop processing, VoIP phone systems go silent,
            cloud-based scheduling and dispatch tools become unreachable, and your team loses access to email and critical business applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            SwitchPoint solves this with a managed LTE failover device installed at your business. The device monitors your primary
            internet connection and automatically switches to cellular backup within 10 to 30 seconds when an outage is detected.
            When the ISP restores service, the device switches back. No manual intervention required.
          </p>

          <h3>Automatic internet backup for businesses across seven states</h3>
          <p>
            SwitchPoint provides automatic internet failover and LTE backup for businesses in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
            West Virginia, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky. Our service is designed for any business that
            depends on internet connectivity for daily operations &mdash; offices, medical practices, dental clinics,
            veterinary offices, retail stores, restaurants, law firms, accounting firms, insurance agencies,
            real estate offices, contractors, HVAC companies, plumbing businesses, electrical contractors,
            auto dealerships, and any other organization where an internet outage means lost productivity or lost revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike consumer-grade solutions, SwitchPoint is a fully managed service. We handle the hardware, the SIM,
            the installation, the monitoring, and the support. You get a single point of contact for your internet backup
            &mdash; not a box you have to figure out on your own.
          </p>

          <h3>Works with any internet provider in PA, OH, WV, NY, MD, VA, or KY</h3>
          <p>
            SwitchPoint is not tied to any specific internet provider. Our LTE failover device works above your existing
            ISP connection regardless of who provides it. This includes major providers operating in our service area:
            Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum (Charter), Verizon Fios, AT&amp;T Fiber, AT&amp;T Internet, Frontier Communications,
            Consolidated Communications, Breezeline, Suddenlink (Altice), Windstream, T-Mobile Home Internet, Starlink,
            and any fixed wireless, DSL, cable, or fiber provider. If you have an internet connection, we can put
            automatic LTE failover in front of it.
          </p>

          <h3>What to do when your business internet goes down</h3>
          <p>
            If your business internet keeps going down, an automatic LTE failover system gives you a safety net that
            activates before you even notice the outage. Rather than waiting for your ISP to restore service &mdash;
            which can take minutes or hours &mdash; your operations continue running on cellular backup. This is especially
            critical for businesses in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia where ISP options may be limited and
            outage response times vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            SwitchPoint is a proactive solution. You install it before outages happen, and it works automatically
            when they do. No switching cables, no calling your ISP, no downtime.

          <details class="card">
            <summary>Is SwitchPoint an internet provider?</summary>
            <p>
              No. SwitchPoint is not an ISP, carrier, or utility. Your primary internet service remains with your existing provider.
              We install and manage a failover device that switches to LTE only when the primary link fails.
              We serve businesses across PA, OH, WV, NY, MD, VA, and KY.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>Do I need to change my internet provider?</summary>
            <p>
              No. SwitchPoint works with your current provider &mdash; Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Frontier, or any other ISP.
              We sit above your existing connection and provide continuity during outages. Nothing changes about your day-to-day internet.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>What states does SwitchPoint serve?</summary>
            <p>
              We provide managed LTE failover service across Pennsylvania (PA), Ohio (OH), West Virginia (WV),
              New York (NY), Maryland (MD), Virginia (VA), and Kentucky (KY). We travel to your business location
              for installation. If you're outside these states but within driving distance, reach out &mdash; we may still be able to help.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>Do I need a static IP address?</summary>
            <p>
              Usually no. This service is designed primarily for outbound business continuity during outages.
              If your environment requires inbound access or special routing, we can review it as a higher-tier deployment.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>What happens when the LTE data cap is used up?</summary>
            <p>
              The LTE backup stops at the cap to prevent unexpected costs. At that point you can either wait for the
              primary ISP to return, or authorize additional LTE capacity to stay online during the outage.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>Will LTE failover work during a power outage?</summary>
            <p>
              If the building has no power, your network equipment will shut down. LTE failover protects against
              ISP outages while the building has power. For brief power outages, a small UPS can keep the modem
              and SwitchPoint device running for 30&ndash;60+ minutes.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>How fast does the automatic failover happen?</summary>
            <p>
              Most environments fail over within about 10 to 30 seconds. We test failover during installation
              so you see exactly how it works before we leave.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>What internet providers does LTE failover work with?</summary>
            <p>
              SwitchPoint works alongside any internet provider &mdash; Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon Fios, AT&amp;T,
              Frontier, Consolidated, Breezeline, Suddenlink, Windstream, T-Mobile Home Internet, Starlink,
              or any other ISP in PA, OH, WV, NY, MD, VA, or KY. We sit above the provider, not in place of it.

          </details>
          <details class="card">
            <summary>What should I do when my business internet goes down?</summary>
            <p>
              If your business internet goes down, operations stop &mdash; payments fail, phones drop, and cloud tools
              become inaccessible. An automatic LTE failover device from SwitchPoint switches your connection
              to cellular backup within seconds, keeping your business running while the ISP restores service.
              This is a proactive solution you install before outages happen.
